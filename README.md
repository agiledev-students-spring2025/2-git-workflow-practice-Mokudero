**Key Highlight:**
1. I find this artcle interesting because it dicusses the efficiency of deep learning models by leveraging data redundancies. This is done keeping user freindliness in mind as in the past
many developers and progrman have paid not a great mind to as its done today, by *employing an accessible programming language*. Additionally I also find this interesting because it mentions how 
the system can be applied to scientific computing, which can further research at a quicker rate.
## Comment from Leo Zhou
This is really cool because it makes AI more efficient and accessible. Instead of experts having to manually optimize AI models, this system does it automatically. It's like having a smart assistant that helps make AI programs run better without requiring deep technical knowledge.
